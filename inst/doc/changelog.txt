23 October 2009, edgeR 1.3.11

- added invisible outputs to maPlot()

22 October 2009, edgeR 1.3.10

- added calcNormFactors()

21 October 2009, edgeR 1.3.9

- added a couple checks to estimateCommonDisp(), estimateTagwiseDisp() and exactTest() for the no replication case
- fixed the way 'pair' is dealt with in exactTest()

12 October 2009, edgeR 1.3.7

- updated of most functions; several new capabilities added (e.g. subsetting of DGEList and TopTags objects)
- vignette radically overhauled, now with three case studies (SAGE, deep-sequenced short tag and RNA-seq data)n

9 September 2009, edgeR 1.3.6

- very substantial overhaul of most functions; greatly increased speed; accuracy should also be improved
- new functions: commonCondLogLikDerDelta, de4DGE, equalizeLibSizes, estimateCommonDisp, estimateDispIter, estimateSmoothing, estimateTagwiseDisp, plotFC, q2qnbinompm, q2qpoispm,weightedCondLogLikDerDelta 
- estimateSmoothing and de4DGE replace alpha.approxeb and deDGE as the functions a user will use to analyze data
