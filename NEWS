CHANGES IN VERSION 2.3.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    
    o estimateCRDisp is removed. It is now replaced by estimateGLMCommonDisp,
      estimateGLMTrendedDisp and estimateGLMTagwiseDisp.
    
    o Changes to glmFit so that it automatically detects dispersion 
      estimates if in data object. It uses tagwise if available, then 
      trended, then common.

    o Add getPriorN.R to calculate the weight given to the common parameter 
      likelihood in order to smooth (or stabilize) the dispersion estimates, 
      and use getPriorN as default for estimateTagwiseDisp and estimateGLMTagwiseDisp
    
    o New function cutWithMinN used in binning methods.
    
    o glmFit now S3 generic function, and glmFit has new method argument 
      specifying fitting algorithm.
    
    o Added subsetting capability for DGEGLM objects.
    
    o plotMDS.dge is retired, instead a DGEList method is now defined for 
      plotMDS in the limma package. Now it takes distance matrix, and avoid 
      over calculation.
    
    o Add as.data.frame method for TopTags objects.
    
    o Added a function cpm to calculate counts per million conveniently. 
    
    o Adding args to dispCoxReidInterpolateTagwise to give more access to 
      tuning parameters.
    
    o Add spliceVariants to the package--methods for detecting alternative exon 
      usage from exon-level count data.
      
    o exactTest now uses new methods (exactTestDoubleTail and exactTestBetaApprox). 
      It is much faster and use less memory. The arguments of exactTest are also
      changed.
        
    o estimateGLMTagwiseDisp now uses trended.dispersion by default if 
      trended.dispersion is found.
      
    o Change to glmLRT to ensure character coefficient argument will work.
    
    o Change to maPlot so that any really extreme logFCs are brought back 
      to a more reasonable scale.
      
    o estimateGLMCommonDisp now returns NA when there are no residual df.

    o Changed computation of local common likelihood in dispCoxReidInterpolateTagwise 
      from using lowess to using movingAverageByCol.


BUG FIXES

    o Bug fix to mglmOneWay, which was confusing parametrizations 
      when the design matrix included negative values.

    o Changes to offset behaviour in estimateGLMCommonDisp, 
      estimateGLMTrendedDisp and estimateGLMTagwiseDisp to fix bug. 
      Changes to several other functions on the way to fixing bugs 
      when computing dispersions in data sets with genes that have 
      all zero counts.

    o dispDeviance and dispPearson now give graceful estimates and messages 
      when the dispersion is outside the specified interval.

    o Fixed the bug that mglmOneWay (and hence glmFit) was producing NA 
      coefficients when some of the fitted values were exactly zero.

    o Fixed the bug that exactTest was giving incorrect results when some of 
      the tags had entirely zero counts.

    o Bug fix to mglmSimple which causes error at some stage.
    
    o Bug fix to adjustedProfLik when there are fitted values exactly at zero 
      for one or more groups.

    o Bug fix to exactTest so that large dispersions do not give wrong
      p-values.

    o Fixed a bug in binGLMDispersion that was causing estimateGLMTrendedDisp
      to fail on datasets with small numbers of genes. Extra warnings added to
      explain this behaviour.


CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Reflect major new functionality for GLMs.

    o New functions dispCoxReidPowerTrend, goodTuringProportions, adjustedProfLik,
      expandAsMatrix, dispCoxReid and getOffsets.

BUG FIXES

    o Correcting use of offsets in the call to glmFit from glmLRT.

    o Changes to binMeanVar so that averaging in bins of mean and variance
      is now done on the square-root scale so that there is less upward bias 
      in the averages.

    o Bug fixing for adjustedProfileLik being aliased twice.
    
    o Bug fixing in estimateGLMTagwiseDisp.DGEList which popped up when using
      method=common.
    

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o New functions goodTuring and mglmLS. Now esitmateCRDisp calls mglmLS.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixing convergence problems for adjustedProfileLik.
    
    o Fixes to estimateCRDisp.R to make convergence more secure.
    
    o glmFit no longer converts data to DGEList.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Introducing negative binomial GLM methods to allow the analysis of complicated
      experimental designs. Introducing methods to help assess and account for NB 
      dispersion that depends on the expression level genes. Add many new functions 
      (glmNBOneGroup, glmfit, meanvar, decidetestsDGE)

    o topTags will now use logFC as secondary ranking when p-values are identical.

    o Add dim and length methods for DGEList, DGEGLM and DGELRT class objects and friends.
    
    o Add norm.factors column to the element of DGEList objects.
    
    o Subsetting added for DGEExact objects and option for the number of bins for getting 
      average means and variances added to plotMeanVar.
      
    o readDGE has new argument labels. Also uses row.names of targets frame for labels 
      if such exist.

BUG FIXES

    o Fix to plotMDS.dge so that it gives the same result regardless of group
      setting of DGEList
    
    o Bug fix to plotMDS.dge so that definition of experimental groups does 
      not affect the MDS plot
      

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o 'dispersion' argument added to exactTest so that a user can specify value(s) for the 
      dispersion when doing the exact test.
      
    o Add plotMDS.dge to the package with documentation.

BUG FIXES

    o Bug fix in estimateSmoothing.
    
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o New functions added: calcNormFactors, estimateCommonDisp, estimateTagwiseDisp, 
      estimateSmoothing, exactTest, equaliseLibSizes, plotSmear, maplot, plotFC.
