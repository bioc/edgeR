CHANGES IN VERSION 2.4.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES
      
    o New function spliceVariants for detecting alternative exon usage
		from exon-level count data.

    o A choice of rejection regions is now implemented for exactTest,
		and the default is changed from one based on small probabilities
		to one based on doubling the smaller of the tail probabilities.
		This gives better results than the original conditional test when
		the dispersion is large (especially > 1).  A Beta distribution
		approximation to the tail probability is also implemented when
		the counts are large, allowing exactTest() to be much faster and
		use less memory.
      
    o exactTest now uses tagwise.dispersion by default if found in the
		object.
    
    o estimateCRDisp is removed. It is now replaced by
		estimateGLMCommonDisp, estimateGLMTrendedDisp and
		estimateGLMTagwiseDisp.
    
    o Changes to glmFit so that it automatically detects dispersion
		estimates if in data object. It uses tagwise if available, then
		trended, then common.

    o Add getPriorN() to calculate the weight given to the common
		parameter likelihood in order to smooth (or stabilize) the
		dispersion estimates. Used as default for estimateTagwiseDisp and
		estimateGLMTagwiseDisp.
    
    o New function cutWithMinN used in binning methods.
    
    o glmFit now S3 generic function, and glmFit has new method
		argument specifying fitting algorithm.
    
    o DGEGLM objects now subsettable.
    
    o plotMDS.dge is retired, instead a DGEList method is now defined for 
      plotMDS in the limma package.  One advantage is that the plot can
      be repeated with different graphical parameters without recomputing
      the distances.  The MDS method is also now much faster.
    
    o Add as.data.frame method for TopTags objects.
    
    o New function cpm to calculate counts per million conveniently. 
    
    o Adding args to dispCoxReidInterpolateTagwise to give more access to 
      tuning parameters.
    
    o estimateGLMTagwiseDisp now uses trended.dispersion by default if 
      trended.dispersion is found.
      
    o Change to glmLRT to ensure character coefficient argument will work.
    
    o Change to maPlot so that any really extreme logFCs are brought back 
      to a more reasonable scale.
      
    o estimateGLMCommonDisp now returns NA when there are no residual
      df rather than returning dispersion of zero.

    o The trend computation of the local common likelihood in
      dispCoxReidInterpolateTagwise is now based on moving averages
      rather than lowess.

    o Changes to binGLMDispersion to allow trended dispersion for data
      sets with small numbers of genes, but with extra warnings.

BUG FIXES

    o dispDeviance and dispPearson now give graceful estimates and
		messages when the dispersion is outside the specified interval.

    o Bug fix to mglmOneWay, which was confusing parametrizations when
		the design matrix included negative values.

    o mglmOneWay (and hence glmFit) no longer produces NA coefficients
		when some of the fitted values were exactly zero.

    o Changes to offset behaviour in estimateGLMCommonDisp,
		estimateGLMTrendedDisp and estimateGLMTagwiseDisp to fix bug.
		Changes to several other functions on the way to fixing bugs
		when computing dispersions in data sets with genes that have all
		zero counts.

    o Bug fix to mglmSimple with matrix offset.
    
    o Bug fix to adjustedProfLik when there are fitted values exactly
		at zero for one or more groups.


CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Reflect major new functionality for GLMs.

    o New functions dispCoxReidPowerTrend, goodTuringProportions, adjustedProfLik,
      expandAsMatrix, dispCoxReid and getOffsets.

BUG FIXES

    o Correcting use of offsets in the call to glmFit from glmLRT.

    o Changes to binMeanVar so that averaging in bins of mean and variance
      is now done on the square-root scale so that there is less upward bias 
      in the averages.

    o Bug fixing for adjustedProfileLik being aliased twice.
    
    o Bug fixing in estimateGLMTagwiseDisp.DGEList which popped up when using
      method=common.
    

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o New functions goodTuring and mglmLS. Now esitmateCRDisp calls mglmLS.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixing convergence problems for adjustedProfileLik.
    
    o Fixes to estimateCRDisp.R to make convergence more secure.
    
    o glmFit no longer converts data to DGEList.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Introducing negative binomial GLM methods to allow the analysis of complicated
      experimental designs. Introducing methods to help assess and account for NB 
      dispersion that depends on the expression level genes. Add many new functions 
      (glmNBOneGroup, glmfit, meanvar, decidetestsDGE)

    o topTags will now use logFC as secondary ranking when p-values are identical.

    o Add dim and length methods for DGEList, DGEGLM and DGELRT class objects and friends.
    
    o Add norm.factors column to the element of DGEList objects.
    
    o Subsetting added for DGEExact objects and option for the number of bins for getting 
      average means and variances added to plotMeanVar.
      
    o readDGE has new argument labels. Also uses row.names of targets frame for labels 
      if such exist.

BUG FIXES

    o Fix to plotMDS.dge so that it gives the same result regardless of group
      setting of DGEList
    
    o Bug fix to plotMDS.dge so that definition of experimental groups does 
      not affect the MDS plot
      

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o 'dispersion' argument added to exactTest so that a user can specify value(s) for the 
      dispersion when doing the exact test.
      
    o Add plotMDS.dge to the package with documentation.

BUG FIXES

    o Bug fix in estimateSmoothing.
    
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o New functions added: calcNormFactors, estimateCommonDisp, estimateTagwiseDisp, 
      estimateSmoothing, exactTest, equaliseLibSizes, plotSmear, maplot, plotFC.
